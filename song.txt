There ain’t no gold
In this river
That I’ve been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope
In these waters
But I can’t bring myself to swim 
When I am drowning 
In this silence, baby let me in

Chorus:
Go easy on me baby
I was still a child
Didn’t get the chance to 
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain’t no room 
For things to change
When we are both so deeply 
Stuck in our ways
You can’t deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was
To put you both first
But now I give up

Chorus:
Go easy on me baby
I was still a child
Didn’t get the chance to 
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me

I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn’t even show
